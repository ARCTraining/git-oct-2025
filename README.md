**Fill in the blanks and discover what happens when science meets the supernatural!**

It was a **chilly** October night when Dr. **Blackwell** was working late in their **dimly lit** laboratory. They had been studying **fungal spores** for **7** months, hoping to make a **groundbreaking** breakthrough.

As they **flipped** through their research notes, something **unnerving** caught their eye. A petri dish containing **slimy goo** was **floating** three feet above the lab bench!

"This is **impossible**!" they whispered, adjusting their **goggles** nervously. The dish began to **vibrate** in a **spiral** pattern, glowing with a **green** light.

Suddenly, a **raspy** voice echoed through the lab:  
"Your research on **quantum entanglement** has awakened us! We are the spirits of **12** researchers who died from **tripping over extension cords**!"

Dr. **Blackwell** grabbed their **micropipette** and **ran** toward the exit, but the ghostly petri dish **overtook** them, leaving behind only the smell of **burnt marshmallows** and a mysterious **purple** residue.

*The next morning, their lab mates found only a **crumpled** note that read:*  
*"Gone to study **ectoplasmic microbiology** with the ghost researchers. Back by **Thursday**... maybe."* ðŸ‘»ðŸ§ª


**ðŸ§¬ Happy Halloween from the haunted lab! ðŸ‘»**
